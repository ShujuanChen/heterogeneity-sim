# Heterogeneity Sim

This repository contains code to conduct simulation studies on methods to estimate treatment heterogeneity. 

In this initial phase of the project, we are working on the `sim_run_grf.R` file. 

TODO: 

1) verify that the parallel processing code works as expected on cluster

2) select appropriate values for param1 and param2

3) verify that results are reproducible: two short runs under the same seed
